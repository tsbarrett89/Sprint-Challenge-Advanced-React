- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Because the app is already using class components and you are told to.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    render() - only required method. It renders the app during the mounting and updating times.
    componentDidMount() - is called once your component is mounted
    componentDidUpdate() - is called whenever updating occurs

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    Custom hooks allows you to create a function that can be used and reused much like components.

    Improve functionality. Find bugs early so that it doesnt crash later with future updates
